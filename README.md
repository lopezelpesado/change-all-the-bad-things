# change all the bad things

Had I more time, I would:

- add better validation of DOB (check over 18, check not in future)
- add better validation of email using regex
- add better validation of phone number using regex
- research and implement a way of storing the form in a database and confirm with the user the data was stored successfully
- create a new page that displayed the information that was received and thanked the user, instead of the alert
- create styled pop up boxes instead of alerts when a required form element is missing or incorrect
